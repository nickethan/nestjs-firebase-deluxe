 # NestJs Firebase Cloud Functions (modified)

This has been modified to support an API, firestore triggers and tasking via Cloud Functions -- Nick.

Steps to follow to work on this template:

 1. Clone this repository
 2. Set up your firebase project with: `firebase init`
 3. Change to the functions folder `cd ./functions/`
 4. Install all dependencies `npm intall`
 5. Do a local test with the firebase local server `npm run serve` so you can see that everything is fine.
 6. Once you see it running without errors in your local environment, take the project to the server `npm run deploy`
 7. **Start the development of your back end using nestJs:** `npm run start:dev`
